**DESCRIPTION**
God at Work is a sandbox-style game where you play as a god shaping a randomly generated world for a single character. With every action — from giving him a hamburger to unleashing zombie bunnies — you influence our character’s mood and the world around him. Powered by Gemini, an LLM, reactions are unique each time, based on defined profession and your divine decisions. Choose wisely, or face a fiery transformation. It’s a lighthearted experiment in choice, consequence, and chaos — all driven by AI.
